# RealEstate-Marketplace

### As we all know a Blockchain is a Disruptive technology and Real estate hasnâ€™t escaped from blockchain disruption . Previously, transacting high value assets such as real estate exclusively through digital channels has never been the norm. Real estate transactions are often conducted offline involving face-to-face engagements with various entities. Blockchain, however, opened up ways to change this. The introduction of Smart Contracts in blockchain platforms now allows assets like real estate to be tokenized and be traded like cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether.

## Pain Points in RealEsate that this project is focussing to solve :-
Real estate is incredibly complicated, Ask anyone who's ever bought land or a home it's Time-consuming, Complex, Risky and above all else it's expensive Home Inspectors , Real Estate Agents, Banks, Local Governments everyone needs to check and sign off on your transaction before it can get done and all of them take a cut.

## Scope of the Project :-
In This Project we are gonna show how blockchain technology can make the process of buying and selling real estate much much easier. This work like landowner created a hashes for their land along with the Price. this hash is then tied to the owner's ID and connected to the blockchain since hashes are always a unique value every plot of land and land owner will have a unique ID when linked together Plus because of the blockchains immutability no one can tamper with the records this would create a system of verifiably owned land that could easily be transferred bought and sold in a cryptographically secure manner.

# This Project is Divided into Two parts :
## Smart Contract Deploymet.
## Interactive Frontend.
