# RealEstate-Marketplace

### As we all know a Blockchain is a Disruptive technology and Real estate hasnâ€™t escaped from blockchain disruption . Previously, transacting high value assets such as real estate exclusively through digital channels has never been the norm. Real estate transactions are often conducted offline involving face-to-face engagements with various entities. Blockchain, however, opened up ways to change this. The introduction of Smart Contracts in blockchain platforms now allows assets like real estate to be tokenized and be traded like cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether.
